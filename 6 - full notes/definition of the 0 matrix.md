# definition of the 0 matrix

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::02 Linear Systems and matrices 
Q: What is  the zero matrix?
A: The $m \times n$ matrix whose entries are all 0 is called the zero matrix, and is denoted by $0_{m \times n}$.
Given any $A \in \operatorname{Mat}_{m \times n}$, we have that $A + 0_{m \times n} = A$.
