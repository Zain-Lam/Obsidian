# simultaneous equation example 2

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::01 Column Vectors in Real^n 
Q: Solve for $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ the following $$
\lambda_{1}\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} +
\lambda_{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1\\-1\\1\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 5 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
$$
A: This is equivalent to solving the system of simultaneous equations $$
\begin{align*}
2\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} &= 1 \\
\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2} &= 5 \\
3\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} &= 3
\end{align*}
$$Add the first two equations to show that if there are any solutions then they must satisfy $\lambda_{1}=2$, when we sub this into the first equation to get $\lambda_{2}=-3$
we must __REMEMBER TO CHECK__ that this satisfies all the equations, which it does so the system has a _unique solution_.
