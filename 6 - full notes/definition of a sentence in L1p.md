TD: YEAR1::TERM2::PH136 Logic 1
Q: What is the definition of a sentence in $L_{1_{p}}$
?
A:1) All atomic sentences of $L_{1_{p}}$ are sentences of $L_{1_{p}}$
2) If $\phi$ is a sentence of $L_{1_{p}}$, then $\lnot \phi$ is a sentence of $L_{1_{p}}$
3) If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are sentences of $L_{1_{p}}$, then $(\phi \land \psi),(\phi \lor\psi),(\phi\to \psi),(\phi\leftrightarrow \psi)$ are sentences of $L_{1_{p}}$.
4) These cover all the sentences of $L_{1_{p}}$.
