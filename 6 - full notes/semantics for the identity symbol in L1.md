# semantics for the identity symbol in L1

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::PH136 Logic 1
Q: What are the semantics for the identity symbol in $L_{1}$
?
A:The interpretation of ‘=’ is always the same.
We can say that it is paired with the relation of numerical identity. The truth conditions of each atomic sentence formed by mean of ‘=’ are as follows. For any pair of constants $c_1$ and $c_2$, $c_1=c_2$ is true _iff_ the object assigned to $c_1$ and the object assigned to $c_2$ are one and the same object.
