# unit hemisphere domain

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::03 Partial Differentiation and applications
Q: Describe the surface of the unit hemisphere (centred at the origin) as a graph $z = f(x, y)$ where $z \geq 0$. Write down the domain of $f$.
A: We know the equation for a unit sphere is given by $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$, so we can write our function
$f:D\to \mathbb{R}$ as $f(x,y)=\sqrt{ 1-x^{2}-y^{2} }$ by rearranging for $z$, this already gives us the hemisphere as $z$ is always non negative.
It follows that the domain, $D=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^{2}\mid x^{2}+y^{2}\leq 1\}$.
