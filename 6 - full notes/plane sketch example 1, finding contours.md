# plane sketch example 1, finding contours

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::03 Partial Differentiation and applications
Q: For the surface given by $z = f(x, y) = 6 - 3x - 2y$ where $x, y \geq 0$, locate all points on the domain that are mapped by $f$ to $0,3$ and $6$. And what are these called?
A: This is done easily by just setting $z$ to $\{0,3,6\}$ and drawing these on $x,y$ axis so we have $$
\begin{align}
f=0 &\Rightarrow &3x+2y&=6 \\
f=3 &\Rightarrow &3x+2y&=3 \\
f=6 &\Rightarrow &3x+2y&=0
\end{align}
$$giving us the ___contours___ of these lines
