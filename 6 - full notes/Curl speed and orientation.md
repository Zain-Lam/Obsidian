# Curl speed and orientation

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::08 Green's and Stokes
Q: If $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)$ is the velocity of a fluid at a given point $(x, y, z)$ then how can use the curl to define the speed and orientation of the rotation?
A: Its magnitude is proportional to the rotation speed, and its direction is normal to the rotation plane.
