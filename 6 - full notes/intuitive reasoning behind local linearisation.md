# intuitive reasoning behind local linearisation

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA139 Analysis 2::02 Limits and the derivative
Q: What is the intuitive reasoning behind the local linearisation lemma?
A: The lemma says that if $x$ is close to $c$, then $f(x)$ is approximately given by the linear function
$$
x \mapsto f(c) + f'(c)(x - c),
$$
which is the first Taylor approximation to $f$.
