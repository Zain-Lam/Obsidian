# definition of a line integral

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::08 Green's and Stokes
Q: What is the form of a line integral?
A: in the form $$ \int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}, $$where $\mathbf{F} : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector field and $C$ is a curve parametrised by $\mathbf{r}(t)$ with $t \in [a, b]$, and in practise it is evaluated by writing it as $$
 \int\limits_{a}^{b} \mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{\underline{r}}}{dt}dt 
$$and since $\frac{d\underline{\mathbf{r}}}{dt}$ is the tangent vector along the line $C$, the line integral is basically the tendency of the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ to point in the same direction as $C$.
