# definition of a complement subspace

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::05 Linear Maps
Q: Given a vector space $V$ where $U \subset V$ a subspace, how do we define the complement to $U$?
A: $U'$ is called a complement to $U$ if and only if $V = U + U'$ and $U \cap U' = \{0_V\}$.
i.e together they fill the original vector space, and they have no intersect.
