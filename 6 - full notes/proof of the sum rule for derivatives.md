# proof of the sum rule for derivatives

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA139 Analysis 2::02 Limits and the derivative
Q: Prove the sum rule for derivatives.
A: $$
\frac{(f(x) + g(x)) - (f(c) + g(c))}{x - c} = \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} + \frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c}.
$$
Algebra of limits tells us that as $x \to c$, this approaches
$$
f'(c) + g'(c).
