Q: Consider a standard 8 Ã— 8 chessboard consisting of 64 small squares coloured in the usual pattern, so 32 are black and 32 are white. A zig-zag path across the board is a collection of eight white squares, one in each row, which meet at their corners. How many zig-zag paths are there?
A: Use tabulation :D (296 if you are bothering)
