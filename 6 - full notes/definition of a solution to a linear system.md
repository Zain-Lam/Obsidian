# definition of a solution to a linear system

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::02 Linear Systems and matrices 
Q: Describe a solution to a linear system and its semantics.
A: Any vector $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)^T \in \mathbb{R}^n$ which satisfies the matrix is called a _solution_.
If the linear has at least one solution then it is called _consistent._
The _general solution_ is any description of all solutions to the system.
