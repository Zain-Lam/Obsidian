# Definition of a sentence in L1

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::PH136 Logic 1
Q: What is the definition of a sentence in $L_{1}$
?
A:1. All atomic sentences are sentences of L1.
2. If $\phi$ is a sentence of $L_{1}$, then Â¬$\phi$ is a sentence of $L_1$.
3. If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are sentences of $L_1$, then $(\phi \land \psi), (\phi \lor \psi), (\phi \implies \psi), (\phi \iff \psi)$ are sentences of $L_1$.
4. These are all the sentences of $L_1$.

We use $\phi ,\psi, \chi$ as sentence variables. They stand for any sentence in the formal language (atomic or complex).
