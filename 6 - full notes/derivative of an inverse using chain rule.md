# derivative of an inverse using chain rule

Q: Work out the derivative of an inverse using the chain rule.
?
A:Suppose $f$ and $g$ are inverses and we know that they are differentiable: then $$ f(g(x))=x$$on the domain of $g$. We can differentiate this equation using the chain rule to get$$ f'(g(x)) g'(x) = 1 $$and thus we conclude that  
$$ g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}$$
