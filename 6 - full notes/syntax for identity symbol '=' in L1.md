# syntax for identity symbol '=' in L1

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::PH136 Logic 1
Q: What is the syntax for the identity symbol '=' in $L_{1}$
A: ‘=’ combines with two constants to form an atomic sentence.
note that this predicate does not use brackets, unlike $F(x,y)$
So, $a=b; a=a$, etc. are atomic sentences, and thus sentences, of $L_1$.
