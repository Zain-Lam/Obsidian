TD: YEAR1::TERM1::MA151 Algebra 1::05 The order of an element
Q: Prove that $g$ has order 1 _iff_ $g$ is the identity element.
 A: Let $G$ be a group. Suppose $g$ has order 1. By definition of order, $g^{1}=1$, so $g=1$ which is the identity element. Conversely, the identity element clearly has order 1.
