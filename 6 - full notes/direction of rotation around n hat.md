# direction of rotation around n hat

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::08 Green's and Stokes
Q: Describe how the pointwise circulation tells us the direction of rotation of fluid around $\hat{n}$.
A: Make a thumbs-up gesture with your right hand, and align the thumb in the direction of $\hat{n}$. If $\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{n} > 0$, then the direction in which the fluid locally rotates around $\hat{n}$ is the direction in which your other fingers curl. If $\operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{n} < 0$, the fluid rotates in the opposite direction to your fingers.
