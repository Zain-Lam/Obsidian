# physical representation of a line integral

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::08 Green's and Stokes
Q: If $\mathbf{F}$ represents a force acting on an object, then what does the line integral represent?
A: the energy spent in moving it along the curve $C$ from $t = a$ to $t = b$. In physics, this is called the work done on the object by $\mathbf{F}$.
