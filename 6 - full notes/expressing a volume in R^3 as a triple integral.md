# expressing a volume in R^3 as a triple integral

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::05 Cartesian Coordinates
Q: What steps do we take to represent a volume in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by using a triple integral?
A: 1) Start by working out the limits of the double integral describing the region $R \subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}$ over which the volume occupies (use the previous recipe.)
2) Add one more integral in $\mathrm{d}z$ as the innermost integral. This (usually) has the most complicated limits which are typically functions of x and y.
3) To work out the limits in 2, freeze a cuboid at a random potion in $R$. What $z$ values must the cuboid sweep out to generate the volume?
4) **CHECK** that the outermost limits are always numbers. All variables must be integrated away into a number as you work from inside out.
