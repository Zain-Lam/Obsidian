# proof that differentiability implies continuity at a point

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA139 Analysis 2::02 Limits and the derivative
Q: Prove that differentiability at a point implies continuity at the point.
A: We know that
$$
\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} \to f'(c) \quad \text{as} \quad x \to c.
$$
Hence,
$$
f(x) - f(c) = \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} (x - c) \to f'(c) \cdot 0 = 0
$$
as $x \to c$, which implies that $f(x) \to f(c)$ as required.
