# How are individual constants written

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::PH136 Logic 1
Q: How are individual constants written?
A: use _lower_ case letters from the _beginning_ of the alphabet, potentially followed by a numerical index.
e.g $a,a_{1},a_{2}\dots b,b_{1},b_{2}$ 
lower case letters from the _end_ of the alphabet are used as __variables__.
