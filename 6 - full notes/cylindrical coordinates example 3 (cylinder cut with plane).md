# cylindrical coordinates example 3 (cylinder cut with plane)

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::06 Integration with special coordinates
Q: Evaluate $$ \iiint\limits_{\Omega} (x^2 + y^2) \, dV $$where the domain $\Omega$ is the volume bounded by the surfaces $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, $z = 2 - x$, and $z = 0$.
A: After a sketch it makes sense to use cylindrical coordinates, where the bounds for $z$, is done by using the equation of the plane $z=2-r\cos \theta$, and the final result is $\pi$
