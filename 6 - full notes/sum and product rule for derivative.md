# sum and product rule for derivative

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA139 Analysis 2::02 Limits and the derivative
Q: State the sum and product rule for differentiation.
A: Suppose $f, g : I \to \mathbb{R}$ are defined on the open interval $I$ and are differentiable at $c \in I$. Then $f + g$ and $fg$ are differentiable at $c$ and
$$
(f + g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)
$$
and
$$
(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c).
