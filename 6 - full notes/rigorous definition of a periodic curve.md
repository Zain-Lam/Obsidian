# rigorous definition of a periodic curve

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::01 Curves and their parametrisations 
Q: Write down a rigorous definition of what it means for a curve parametrised by $\mathbf{r}: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ to be periodic.
A: A curve $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is periodic with period $T > 0$ if$$
\mathbf{r}(t + T) = \mathbf{r}(t) \quad \forall\ t \in \mathbb{R}.
$$and $T$ is the smallest number such that this property holds.
