# definition of a graph in R3

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::03 Partial Differentiation and applications
Q: Let $f : U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, what is the _graph_ of $f$?
A: The set of points in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ s.t $z=f(x,y)$,
A graph is a surface in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, you can think of it as $z$ being the height associated with each point $(x,y)$.
