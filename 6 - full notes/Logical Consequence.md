# Logical Consequence

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::PH136 Logic 1
Q: When is a sentence $S$ a logical consequence of the sentences $P_{1},\dots P_{n}$
A: _iff_ there is no possible situation in which  $P_{1},\dots P_{n}$ are all true and $S$ is false.
so an _argument_ is logically valid _iff_ its conclusion is a __logical consequence__ of its premises.
