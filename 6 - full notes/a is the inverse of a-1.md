# a is the inverse of a-1

TD: YEAR1::TERM1::MA151 Algebra 1::04 First Theorems and Notation
Q: Let $G$ be a group and $a\in G$, then prove that $(a^{-1})^{-1}=a$
A: We are being asked to show that the inverse of $a$ is $a^{-1}$.
i.e $a^{-1}a=1=aa^{-1}$, but this is clearly true from the definition of $a^{-1}$ being the inverse of $a$.
