# vector-valued function as its components

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::01 Curves and their parametrisations 
Q: How do we write the vector-valued function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ in terms of its components?
A: $$
\mathbf{r}(t) = \big( r_1(t), r_2(t), \dots, r_n(t) \big)
$$where each component function $r_i(t)$ is a real-valued function.
