# rigorous definition of a smooth curve

Q: Define a smooth curve rigorously
A: A curve $\mathcal{C}$ parametrised by $\mathbf{r}(t)$, where $t \in I$, is said to be smooth if each
component $r_i(t)$ is differentiable infinitely many times at all $t \in I$.
Intuitively, a vector-valued function is differentiable if its derivative (which is also a vector) at $t = t_0$ is the same whether $t$ approaches $t_0$ from above or below.
