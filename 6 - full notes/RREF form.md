# RREF form

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::02 Linear Systems and matrices 
Q: What are the 4 criterion for RREF?
A: 1) the first (i.e. leftmost) non-zero entry of any non-zero row is 1 (this is referred to as the leading 1 of the row, or as a pivot);
2) the leading 1 of a non-zero row appears (strictly) to the right of the leading 1s of the nonzero rows above it; 
3) any zero rows appear below the non-zero rows; 
4) in a column that contains the leading 1 of some row, all other entries of that column are zero.
