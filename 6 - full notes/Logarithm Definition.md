Q: Define the logarithm and its basic identities.
?
A:There is a continuous strictly increasing function $x \mapsto \log x$ defined on $(0, \infty)$ satisfying $e^{\log x} = x$ for all positive $x$ and $\log(e^y) = y$ for all real $y$.
We have that for all positive $u$ and $v$,
$$
\log(uv) = \log u + \log v.
