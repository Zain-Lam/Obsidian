# Uniqueness of Inverses in a group

TD: YEAR1::TERM1::MA151 Algebra 1::04 First Theorems and Notation
Q: Prove that the inverse of an element in a group is unique.
?
A:Suppose that $a,b\in G$ are both inverses of $a\in G$. Then we WTS that $b=c$.
We know that $a\star b=b\star a=e$ and $a\star c=c\star a=e$.
Then we have $$\begin{align}b&=b\star e \\&=b \star(a\star c) \\&=(b\star a)\star c \\&=e\star c \\&=c\end{align}$$ showing that $b=c$, so any two inverses of a must be equal.
