# assignment of objects to constants

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::PH136 Logic 1
Q: How are objects assigned to constants in L1
?
A:Each constant that is in use is assigned to one and only one object from the domain, however:
-one object can be assigned to more than one constant (i.e referring to John as $a$ and $b$)
-there can be objects which are not assigned to any constant (nameless objects)
