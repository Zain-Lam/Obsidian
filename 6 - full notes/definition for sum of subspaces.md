# definition for sum of subspaces

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::04 Vector spaces 
Q: If $W_1, W_2 \subset V$ are subspaces of a vector space $V$, then how is their sum defined?
A: Exactly the same as their combined span:
$W_1 + W_2 = \langle W_1 \cup W_2 \rangle$
We can also say this as for any $\underline{\mathbf{v}} \in V$ we have:
$$ v \in W_1 + W_2 \iff \exists\ w_1 \in W_1 \text{ and } w_2 \in W_2 : v = w_1 + w_2. $$
