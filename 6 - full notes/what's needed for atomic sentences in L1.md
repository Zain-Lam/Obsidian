Q: What do we need for atomic sentences to make sense in $L_{1}$
A: 1) A **domain of discourse** (e.g everything, all people, the people currently in this room)
2) An **interpretation of the predicates and constants:**
a) each constant in use is assigned one and only one object from the domain
b) _Very roughly:_ every predicate in use is paired with a property or a relation
