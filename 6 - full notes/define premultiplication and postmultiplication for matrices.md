# define premultiplication and postmultiplication for matrices

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::02 Linear Systems and matrices 
Q: Let $A$ and $B$ be matrices, what is meant by premultiplication and postmultiplication?
A: 1) To premultiply $B$ by $A$ is to perform the matrix multiplication $AB$, i.e., multiplication on the left.
2) To postmultiply $B$ by $A$ is to perform the matrix multiplication $BA$, i.e., multiplication on the right.
