# Datatypes in R

1. _Numeric_: Any number with or without a decimal point: `23`, `0.03`and the numeric null value `NA`.
2. _Character_: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard, usually surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '` or double quotes `" ... "`, though we prefer single quotes.
4. _Logical_: This data type only has two possible values— either `TRUE` or `FALSE` (without quotes).
5. _Vectors_: A list of related data that is all the same type.
6. _NA_: This data type represents the absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `NA` (without quotes) but it has its own significance in the context of the different types. That is there is a numeric NA, a character NA, and a logical NA.
