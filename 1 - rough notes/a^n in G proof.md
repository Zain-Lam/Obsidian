# a^n in G proof

TD: YEAR1::TERM1::MA151 Algebra 1::04 First Theorems and Notation
Q: Let $G$ be a group, and let $a ∈ G$ then prove $a^n ∈ G\ \forall\ n ∈ \mathbb{Z}$.
A: 1) $n=0$, in this first case $a^0=1\in G$ so this is clearly true.
2) if $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we can prove this by induction. This is clearly true for $n=1$ since $a^1=a\in G$. Now suppose that $a^k\in G$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
