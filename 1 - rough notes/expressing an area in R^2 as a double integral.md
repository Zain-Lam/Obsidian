# expressing an area in R^2 as a double integral

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::05 Cartesian Coordinates
Q: What are the 3 steps to forming a double integral in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
A: The steps for $x$ and $y$ can be interchanged
1) Find the range of all possible values for $x$, this must be in terms of _numbers_
2) If the $x$ value is fixed, what value must $y$ take to sweep out the area?
3) Use these to fill in the integration limits
4) **CHECK** that the outermost limits are numbers
