# Pointwise Circulation definition

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::08 Green's and Stokes
Q: What is pointwise circulation and how is it defined?
A: If $P$ lies on a surface $S$ with unit normal $\hat{n}$, the pointwise circulation refers to how much fluid is circling around $\hat{n}$.
It is define by $\nabla \times F\cdot \hat{n}$.
