# Green's Theorem in a plane

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::08 Green's and Stokes
Q: Let $C$ be a positively oriented, simple closed curve and $D$ the region bounded by $C$, state Green's Theorem.
A: For any two-variable functions $P,Q$ that have continuous partial derivatives on the area $D$ we have: $$
\iint\limits_{D}\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right)\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y = \oint\limits_{C} (P\mathrm{d}x+Q\mathrm{d}y)
$$
