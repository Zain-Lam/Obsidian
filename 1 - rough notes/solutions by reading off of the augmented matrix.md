Q: Let $(A \mid \mathbf{b})$ be a matrix in reduced row echelon form which represents a linear system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ of $m$ equations in $n$ variables. Then what can we say about solutions to the linear system?
A: 1) The system has no solutions if and only if the last non-zero row of $(A \mid \mathbf{b})$ is $( 0 \quad 0 \quad \cdots \quad 0 \mid 1 )$
1) The sys
