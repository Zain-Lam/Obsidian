# definition of derivative of a scalar valued function

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::02 Differentiation and arc length
Q: How do we define the derivative of $f$ at $x=c$ by using a limit, and what does it mean?
A: $$
f'(c)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(c + \Delta x) - f(c)}{\Delta x}
$$and the value of $f'(c)$ is equal to the slope of the _tangent_ to the curve at $x=c$.
