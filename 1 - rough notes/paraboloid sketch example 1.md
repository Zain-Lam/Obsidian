TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::03 Partial Differentiation and applications
Q: Sketch $z = f(x, y) = 1 - x^2 - y^2$ where $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. What would you call the surface?
A: The first thing we should notice is that $z\leq 1$, then we can suppress $x$ and $y$ to see that it is an upside down quadratic rotate around the $z$ axis
