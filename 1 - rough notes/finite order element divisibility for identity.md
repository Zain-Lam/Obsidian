TD: YEAR1::TERM1::MA151 Algebra 1::05 The order of an element
Q: Let $m$ be a __non-zero__ integer, then prove that $g^{m}=1 \iff g$ has finite order $d$ with $d |m$.
A: Suppose $g^{m}=1$ where $m$ is a __non-zero__ integer, then $g^{|m|}=1$ and $|m|$ is a positive integer, so $g$ has finite order, which we denote by $d$. By the division algorithm,$$
m=qd+r, \quad q,r\in \mathbb{Z},0\leq r<d
$$Now $g^{d}=1$ by the definition of order, so $1=g$
