# A âˆˆ Matmn and m less than n

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::02 Linear Systems and matrices 
Q: If $A \in \operatorname{Mat}_{m \times n}$ and $m < n$ what can be said about the solutions
A: there exists a nontrivial solution,
the augmented matrix can be turned into RREF, and the last column will be $\underline{\mathbf{0}}$
The RREF has the same number of rows as $A$ but since $n>m$ not all columns will have a pivot, so there are infinitely many solutions, so there is a nontrivial one.
