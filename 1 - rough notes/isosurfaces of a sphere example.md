# isosurfaces of a sphere example

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::03 Partial Differentiation and applications
Q: Let $T : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function defined by $T(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. Describe all points that are mapped by $T$ onto 0, 1, and 2. These are called the isosurfaces of $T$.
A: $$
\begin{align}
T&=0,\quad x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0 \\
T&=1,\quad x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1 \\
T&=2,\quad x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=2
\end{align}
$$
So we can see that these describe sphere's centred around the origin![[MA144 Mod 2 Spheres Isosurfaces sketch sketch.png]]
