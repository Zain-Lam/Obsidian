# isomorphism on a subspace comments

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::05 Linear Maps
Q: Suppose $\varphi: V \rightarrow W$ is an isomorphism and $U \subset V$ is a subspace. What can be said about $\varphi(U)$
A: Then $\varphi$ gives an isomorphism between $U$ and the subspace $\varphi(U) \subset W$. In particular, if $U$ is finite-dimensional, then $\dim U = \dim \varphi(U)$.
