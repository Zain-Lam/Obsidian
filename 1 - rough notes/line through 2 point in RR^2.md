# line through 2 point in RR^2

Q: What is the equation of the line $L_{PQ} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ through the points $P = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $Q = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$?
A: The two points are distinct so there is a unique straight line through these points.
This line will be in the form $ax + by = c$ for some $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$, where multiplying by a non-zero scalar does not change the line.
Treat $a$, $b$, $c$ as unknowns, substitute the two points into the unknown equation and solve:
at $P$: $-2a + b = c$
at $Q$: $4a + 3b = c$
which has solution $a = -\frac{1}{5}\lambda$, $b = \frac{3}{5}\lambda$, and $c = \lambda$ for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$
choose any nonzero solution such as $(a, b, c) = (1, 3, 5)$
giving $L_{PQ}$: $(x + 3y = 5) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$
Now remember to __CHECK__.
