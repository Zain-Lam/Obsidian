# proof that n^3 is not in big O of n

Q: Prove that the function $n^3$ is not in $\mathcal O(n)$.
A: Using a proof by contradiction
Suppose that there exist constants $c > 0$ and $N$ such that $n^3 â‰¤ cn \forall n > N$, but we have $n^3 > cn \forall n > \sqrt{ c }$.
This leads to a contradiction, and concludes the proof.
