# dV as cylindical coordinates

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::06 Integration with special coordinates
Q: If it is easier to work out the region $R$ by using cylindrical integration what is the new $\mathrm{d}V$ if it used to be $\mathrm{d}x\ \mathrm{d}y\ \mathrm{d}z$
A: We can rewrite $\mathrm{d}A$ as $\textcolor{cyan}{r}\ \mathrm{d}r\ \mathrm{d}\theta\ \mathrm{d}z$, we can think of this as 'polar + $z$'
