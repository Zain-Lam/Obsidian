Q: State the definition of the chain rule
A: Suppose $I$ and $J$ are open intervals, $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g: J \to I$, that $g$ is differentiable at $c$, and $f$ is differentiable at $g(c)$. Then the composition $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $c$, and
$$
(f \circ g)'(c) = f'(g(c)) \cdot g'(c).
$$
