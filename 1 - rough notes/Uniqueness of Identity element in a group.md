# Uniqueness of Identity element in a group

TD: YEAR1::TERM1::MA151 Algebra 1::04 First Theorems and Notation
Q: Prove that the group $(G, ⋆)$ has a unique identity element.
A: Suppose that $e$ and $e ′$ are identity elements.
Then $\forall a ∈ G$ we have $a ⋆ e = e ⋆ a = a$, and $a ⋆ e′ = e ′ ⋆ a = a$
Now let us try evaluating $e ⋆ e′$
If we let $a = e$ and use $e′$ as the identity then we get $e ⋆ e′ = e$
But if we let $a = e ′$ and use $e$ as the identity then we get $e⋆ e′ = e ′$ 
Thus $e = e ′$ 
In other words, the identity element is unique.
