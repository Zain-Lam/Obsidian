# finite group implies finite order

TD: YEAR1::TERM1::MA151 Algebra 1::05 The order of an element
Q: Let $G$ be a finite group and $g \in G$, prove $g$ has finite order.
A: . Suppose $g ∈ G$ has infinite order. Then $g^0 , g^1 , g^2 , g^3 , . . .$ are elements of $G$ which are distinct from one another,
If $g^ m = g^ n$ for some natural numbers $m,n$ with $m < n$ then $e = g^0 = g^{ m−m }= g^{n−m}$ and $g$ has finite order.
Since this can't happen in a finite group, so $g$ must have finite order.
