# dimension of a vector space

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA150 Algebra 2::04 Vector spaces 
Q: Given a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, what is its dimension and how is it notated?
A: The number of elements of any basis of $V$ and it is denoted by $\dim V$ or $\dim_{\mathbb{R}}V$ when it is useful to emphasise that the scalars are $\mathbb{R}$.
Note that $\dim V \in \mathbb{N}$.
