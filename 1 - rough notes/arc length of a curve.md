# arc length of a curve

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::02 Differentiation and arc length
Q: How do we find the arc length of the curve parametrised by $\mathbf{r}(t)$ between $t = t_0$ and $t = t_1$?
A: $$
s = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \left\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \right\| \, dt,
$$where $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is the derivative of $\mathbf{r}(t)$ and $\left\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \right\|$ is its magnitude.
Always keep $t_{1}>t_{0}$ to ensure the arc length is always positive.
