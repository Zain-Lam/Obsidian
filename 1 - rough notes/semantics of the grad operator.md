# semantics of the grad operator

TD: YEAR1::TERM2::MA144 Modelling 2::03 Partial Differentiation and applications
Q: Describe the semantics of the grad operator.
A: we can view $\nabla f$ as the result of the _operator_ $\nabla$ acting on the scalar valued function $f$.
The grad operator $\nabla$ takes in a scalar and returns a vector.
